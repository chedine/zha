Execution model
--------------------

- Each block is a list of list.
- Result/output of each element in the outer list is chained as the last input to the next
element in the list.

var result = provided_startVal | nothing
for each ast in list  
    ast.push(result)
    result = eval(ast)

- Where clause provides a supplemental environment.
Alternate form/representation of the scope for the block of code/ function

- Symbols must be looked into the Where env first, and lang runtime next.
- Expressions in where clause cannot create an inner scope again. Do we have to??
