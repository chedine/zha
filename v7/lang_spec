- Lisp at its core
- Evaluation model follows that of Lisp
- Surface syntax wouldn't resemble LISP. Tries to be beginner friendly by reducing parens

### Syntax differences

- [1 2 3] will continue to be a vector of 1,2,3
[   1
        2 3
    4
] - Will be a vector of [1, (2,3), (4)]
- Newlines inside [] mark a new list

- Hence a function of form
(def a-mathy-exp 
    (fn (a b x y)
        (let (ax (mul a x))
             (by (mul b y))
             )))

can also be expressed as 

(def a-mathy-exp [
    fn (a b x y)
        let (ax (mul a x))
        \   (by (mul b y))
])
