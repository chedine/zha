# Inspirations

- Out of the Tar Pit
- Eve (Earlier versions. Experimental versions/protos)
- SubText
- Reframe

## Goals

- A simpler expressive language and an useful programming environment for personal automation / home computing/ end user programming
- Not to be a general purpose, mission critical programming system.
- Easier to comprehend. 
    - With Small computing/personal automation; We do not work on the code base everyday. We get back once in a while.We should be able to get up and running as quickly as possible.
    - The whole system should be easier to comprehend. Where things start, how data flows, what dependencies exist, what is the cost of me touching/breaking something etc..?
- Interactive and visual.
    - The focal point for visualization should be the "System" as a whole and not a tiny piece of pure function.
    - To me a pure function is always easier to read, understand and to reason about. Muddier piece is the big picture.
